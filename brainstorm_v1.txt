Each team can have up to 4 members. Along the way to work for Assignment 1, I would also recommend the team finish the following tasks as well: 

• Create a shared GIT repository 

• Set up a shared working platform (Google doc, Dropbox, etc.) 

• Maintain a list of all team members’ contact information (Email, phone,  

messaging, etc.)
